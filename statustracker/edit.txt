Apache has permissions of all files in statustracker folder.
Therefore all other users are unable to edit them.
Apache needs permissions due to PHP being hosted through them.

To Edit:
sudo chown -R JXC:JXC /var/www/html/statustracker

To Restore Access back to Apache:
sudo chown -R apache:apache /var/www/html/statustracker
